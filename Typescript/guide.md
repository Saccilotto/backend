[Introduction]
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language.
- TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that you can catch errors and bugs before your code runs.
- TypeScript is a compiled language, which means that you write TypeScript and then compile it to JavaScript before you run it.
